# Auth-Tutorial

This project helped me at least to understand how authentication works and the different ways existing to keep the token in other localStorage, sessionStorage and JavaScript Storage.
## launch script

For the proper functioning of the project, you must launch yarn start o npm run start and node server.js simultaneously 
### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

and 
### `node server.js`
